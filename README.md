Contained in the file lru_cache.py is the LRUCache class, which must be initialized with an integer
greater than or equal to 1. It has been tested with Python 3.7 and only uses core language features.

Example:
/*
from lru_cache import LRUCache

c = LRUCache(4)

c.put(1, 2)

c.put("key", "value")

c.get(1)

c.delete("key")

c.reset()
*/

Note that the cache is agnostic with regards to types of keys and types of values.
